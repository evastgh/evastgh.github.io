abstract = {The animation of delicate vortical structures of gas and liquids has been of great interest in computer graphics. However, common velocity-based fluid solvers can damp the vortical flow, while vorticity-based fluid solvers suffer from performance drawbacks. We propose a new velocity-based fluid solver derived from a reformulated Euler equation using covectors. Our method generates rich vortex dynamics by an advection process that respects the Kelvin circulation theorem. The numerical algorithm requires only a small local adjustment to existing advection-projection methods and can easily leverage recent advances therein. The resulting solver emulates a vortex method without the expensive conversion between vortical variables and velocities. We demonstrate that our method preserves vorticity in both vortex filament dynamics and turbulent flows significantly better than previous methods, while also improving preservation of energy.},

  abstract = {We describe a new algorithm that solves a classical geometric problem: Find a surface of minimal area bordered by an arbitrarily prescribed boundary curve. Existing numerical methods face challenges due to the non-convexity of the problem. Using a representation of curves and surfaces via differential forms on the ambient space, we reformulate this problem as a convex optimization. This change of variables overcomes many difficulties in previous numerical attempts and allows us to find the global minimum across all possible surface topologies. The new algorithm is based on differential forms on the ambient space and does not require handling meshes. We adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) to find global minimal surfaces. The resulting algorithm is simple and efficient: it boils down to an alternation between a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and a pointwise shrinkage operation. We also show other applications of our solver in geometry processing such as surface reconstruction.},

  abstract = {We present a Material Point Method for visual simulation of baking breads, cookies, pancakes and similar materials that consist of dough or batter (mixtures of water, flour, eggs, fat, sugar and leavening agents). We develop a novel thermomechanical model using mixture theory to resolve interactions between individual water, gas and dough species. Heat transfer with thermal expansion is used to model thermal variations in material properties. Water-based mass transfer is resolved through the porous mixture, gas represents carbon dioxide produced by leavening agents in the baking process and dough is modeled as a viscoelastoplastic solid to represent its varied and complex rheological properties. Water content in the mixture reduces during the baking process according to Fick's Law which contributes to drying and cracking of crust at the material boundary. Carbon dioxide gas produced by leavening agents during baking creates internal pressure that causes rising. The viscoelastoplastic model for the dough is temperature dependent and is used to model melting and solidification. We discretize the governing equations using a novel Material Point Method designed to track the solid phase of the mixture.},

  abstract = {We present a new hybrid Lagrangian Material Point Method for simulating elastic objects like hair, rubber, and soft tissues that utilizes a Lagrangian mesh for internal force computation and an Eulerian mesh for self collision as well as coupling with external materials. While recent Material Point Method (MPM) techniques allow for natural simulation of hyperelastic materials represented with Lagrangian meshes, they utilize an updated Lagrangian discretization where the Eulerian grid degrees of freedom are used to take variations of the potential energy. This often coarsens the degrees of freedom of the Lagrangian mesh and can lead to artifacts. We develop a hybrid approach that retains Lagrangian degrees of freedom while still allowing for natural coupling with other materials simulated with traditional MPM, e.g. sand, snow, etc. Furthermore, while recent MPM advances allow for resolution of frictional contact with codimensional simulation of hyperelasticity, they do not generalize to the case of volumetric materials. We show that our hybrid approach resolves these issues. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique with examples that involve elastic soft tissues coupled with kinematic skeletons, extreme deformation, and coupling with multiple elastoplastic materials. Our approach also naturally allows for two-way rigid body coupling.},

  abstract = {We present novel techniques for simulating and visualizing ductile fracture with the Material Point Method (MPM). We utilize traditional particle-based MPM [Stomakhin et al. 2013; Sulsky et al. 1994] as well as the Lagrangian energy formulation of [Jiang et al. 2015] that utilizes a tetrahedron mesh, rather than particle-based estimation of the deformation gradient and potential energy. We model failure and fracture via elastoplasticity with damage. Material is elastic until its deformation exceeds a Rankine or von Mises yield condition, at which point we use a softening model that shrinks the yield surface until a damage threshold is reached. Once damaged, the material Lam\'{e} coefficients are modified to represent failed material. We design visualization techniques for rendering the boundary of the material and its intersections with evolving crack surfaces. Our approach uses a simple and efficient element splitting strategy for tetrahedron meshes to represent crack surfaces that utilizes an extrapolation technique based on the MPM simulation. For traditional particle-based MPM we use an initial Delaunay tetrahedralization to connect randomly initialized MPM particles. Our visualization technique is a post-process and can be run after the MPM simulation for efficiency. We demonstrate our method with a number of challenging simulations of ductile failure with considerable and persistent self-contact.},
