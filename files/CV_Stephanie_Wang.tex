\section{Brief intro}
\cvline{}{
    I have worked in and published papers in the fields of \textbf{geometric deep learning}, \textbf{geometry optimization}, and \textbf{physics-based simulation} of all kinds of materials (solids, fluids, waves, cloth, hair, friction / contact, deformable bodies, plasticity, visco-elasto-plasticity, and fracture / damage). My research aims to provide mathematical and engineering solutions to bring the virtual world to reality by building robust and high-performance computer graphics algorithms. 
    % I am interested in finding the next generation of geometry representations that will enable generic 3D generative models, inferences of 3D geometry, and many more 3D technologies.
    % I am interested in industrial positions at which I can utilize both theoretical knowledge and quantitative skills to conduct research with foreseeable applications.
    % \vadjust{\vspace{2pt}}\newline
    % \textbf{Geometric deep learning: }
    % Generative AI has demonstrated huge success in the space of 2D content generation, specifically with text-to-image models. To achieve similar success in 3D content generation, researchers need to build machine learning models that are geometric in nature. Existing neural representations of 3D geometry still face significant challenges, \textit{e.g.} the discontinuity introduced by topological changes. Geometric measure theory is a branch of mathematics that treats 3D geometries as vector fields, generalizing the levelset- and SDF-based models, and has great potential in solving the 3D representation problem. I am interested in finding the bridge between the (sometimes esoteric) math literature and the increasing demand for a modern geometric deep learning model. 
    % \vadjust{\vspace{2pt}}\newline
    % \textbf{Physics modeling: }
    % Physical phenomena like solids, fluids, friction, fracture, and more are crucial in building a appealing virtual world. The demand for high-performance, visually-appealing, and physically-accurate simulation methods are growing across industries. Many face a specific set of constraints and require domain-knowledge to build an optimized simulation pipeline. Film industry demands physically-plausible solutions while preserving art-directability. Game industry requires real-time results on varying hardwares. Manufacturing industry uses simulation to assist design and development as well as to cut costs in manufacturing samples and testing. I have deep understanding in the physics of all of systems that might play a role in any simulated scene, as well as research experience (and publications) in simulating the interaction and coupling of several systems. My experience in developing and maintaining large-scale C++ libraries can also come in handy when building pipelines for high-resolution (large data) or real-time (fast computation) simulations. 
    % \vadjust{\vspace{2pt}}\newline
    % \textbf{Geometry optimization: }
    % Many industrial processes involve geometry. Finding the optimal shape for a new product that balances both manufacturing costs and performance is often the top challenge. Building a differentiable forward simulation pipeline alone is not enough. One also needs to choose the right optimization method in order to obtain the optimal geometry. Mathematical insights for the geometry of the problem can often help boost convergence rate of the optimization problem by \textit{magnitudes}, and sometimes even convert a nonconvex problem into a convex one. 
    % \vadjust{\vspace{2pt}}\newline
    % In addition to my 5-year experience in developing and maintaining C++ code, I also have 4 years of experience using Houdini to implement prototypes and research codes. Developing in Houdini gives short turn-around time (3-5x faster than using C++) and quick visualization during early stages of a research project. 
    %
    %
    % SOME RANDOM DRAFT
    % A physically-plausible simulation engine can enhance the artistic expression and story-telling in animation and games, as well as provide a fast and cheap 
    % I hope to build plausible physical dynamics in animation and games to enable artistic expression and compelling story-telling.
    % The impact that I'm seeking is to enhance users' artistic expression by improving physical dynamics in animation and games to create a more compelling story-telling environment, as well as optimizing the industrial manufacturing processes by involving novel graphics technology in the development phase. 
    % I am also seeking to bridge my decade's worth understanding in the mathematical models in graphics pipeline to machine learning models to enable the next generation of generative AI and content generation. 
    % I have published many scientific papers as well as giving research talks
    % My track record of publications and collaborations with researchers in both academia and industry serves to proof my skills in technical communication and team-building.
    % Points: team-building, Houdini for fast prototyping, fluent technical communication skills.
    % END RANDOM DRAFT
