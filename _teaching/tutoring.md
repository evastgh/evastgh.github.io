I can tutor many upper division Math classes and most lower division ones. I have a strong background in Linear Algebra and Numiercal Methods (see my [teaching experiences](/teaching/TAship)) and would prefer to only tutor these classes. I have a car but would prefer meeting the students on campus or through Skype. Please contact me through email (evast [at] g.ucla.edu).
