### Scallion Pancake

Got too much fat from frying or meat stew? Mix a 50-60% dough (e.g. 120g all purpose flour and 60g water). Soak the dough in some oil (e.g. 1 tbsp) and let rest. Roll the dough flat (0.5cm thin) and sprinkle salt, sliced scallion, and fat on top. Roll the fillings into a cylinder and then into a spiral. Roll flat again (0.3cm thin) and fry on a non-stick pan until crispy and golden.
