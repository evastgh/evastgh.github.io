[TL;DR (one-page resume)](/files/resume.pdf)  

I am expecting to receive my PhD in [Computational Applied Mathematics at University of California -- Los Angeles](https://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam) in Summer 2020. My interests are in physics-based simulations and their applications in computer graphics; my major focus is Material Point Method and its improvements. I am also interested in partial differential equations, especially the ones involving optimization problems (e.g. optimal transport). My advisor is Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). In Summer 2019, I worked at the [Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/slab/) with Prof. [Johan Gaume](https://people.epfl.ch/johan.gaume) on simulations of snow and tire interaction.

**Community Service**  
I was the chief organizer of [Women in Math at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math) and created the [Women In Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math-mentorship-program). I am currently serving as the president of the Math Grad Student Organization and representing in the [Math and Physical Sciences Council](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mpsc/math/).

**Personal**  
I was introduced to rock climbing in early 2017 and it had become my major hobby. See [Gallery](/gallery/).
