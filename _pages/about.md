[TL;DR (one-page resume)](/files/resume.pdf)   
[TL;DR (CV)](/files/cv.pdf)  

My research interests are in physics-based simulations, partial differential equations, and optimization problems. 
I received my PhD in [Computational Applied Mathematics at University of California -- Los Angeles](https://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam) in March 2020. 
My Doctoral Dissertation was on Material Point Method and its improvements. I was advised by Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). 
Right now, I am studying regularity theory for minimizers of polyconvex functionals with Prof. [Wilfrid Gangbo](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wgangbo/) at UCLA. 

**Community Service**  
I was the chief organizer of [Women in Math at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math) during 2016-2018 and created the [Women In Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math-mentorship-program) in 2017. I served as the president of the Math Grad Student Organization during 2018-2020 and represented in the [Math and Physical Sciences Council](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mpsc/math/) during 2017-2020.

**Personal**  
My stay-at-home hobbies during the COVID-19 lockdown include body-weight strength training, cooking, and Animal Crossing.
