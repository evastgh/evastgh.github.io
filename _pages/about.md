I'm a fifth year PhD student at University of California in [Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM)](https://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam). I'm interested in physics-based simulations and their applications in computer graphics; my major focuses are particle based methods (Material Point Method and its improvements). I'm also interested in (partial) differential equations especially the ones involving optimization problems (e.g. optimal transport). My advisor is Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). This summer, I am working at the [Snow and Avalanche Simulation Laboratory of Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/slab/) with Prof. [Johan Gaume](https://people.epfl.ch/johan.gaume) on simulations of snow and tire interaction.

I was the chief organizer of [Women in Math at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math) and created the [Women In Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math-mentorship-program). I am currently serving as the Graduate Student Organization President and a member in the [Math and Physical Sciences Council](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mpsc/math/).

I lived in Taiwan for the most of my life before moving to California to start my graduate studies. I received my B.S. in Mathematics at [National Taiwan University](http://www.math.ntu.edu.tw/en). My academic experience in Taiwan has been very fruitful and prepared me well for the challenges in my graduate program. 

I was introduced to rock climbing in early 2017 and it had become my major hobby. See [Gallery](/gallery/).
