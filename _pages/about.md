[TL;DR (one-page resume)](/files/resume.pdf)   
[TL;DR (CV)](/files/cv.pdf)  


My research interests are in partial differential equations and optimization, with applications in computer graphics (physics simulation and geometric processing). 
Right now, I am a Postdoc at [department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) working with Prof. [Albert Chern](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/). 
I received my PhD in [Computational Applied Mathematics at University of California -- Los Angeles](https://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam) in March 2020. 
My Doctoral Dissertation was on Material Point Method and its improvements, advised by Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). 

**Community Service**  
During my time at UCLA, I took on the leader role of several student organizations including [Women in Math at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math), Math Grad Student Organization, and [Math and Physical Sciences Council](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mpsc/math/).  
I also created the [Women In Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math-mentorship-program) in 2017.  

**Personal**  
My hobbies are rock climbing and hiking. Still waiting to get back to the climbing gyms... 
WiGRAPH featured me in an interview and you can find more about me [here](https://www.wigraph.org/post-postdocs.html)!
