[TL;DR (one-page resume)](/files/resume.pdf)   
[TL;DR (CV)](/files/cv.pdf)  

My research interests are in partial differential equations and optimization, with applications in computer graphics (physics simulation and geometric processing). 
Right now, I am a Postdoc at [department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) working with Prof. [Albert Chern](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/). 
I received my PhD in [Computational Applied Mathematics at University of California -- Los Angeles](https://www.math.ucla.edu/research/cam) in March 2020. 
My Doctoral Dissertation was on Material Point Method and its improvements, advised by Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). 

**Community Service**  
I was the chief organizer of [Women in Math at UCLA](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math) during 2016-2018 and created the [Women In Math Mentorship Program](https://www.math.ucla.edu/grad/women-in-math-mentorship-program) in 2017. I served as the president of the Math Grad Student Organization during 2018-2020 and represented in the [Math and Physical Sciences Council](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mpsc/math/) during 2017-2020, contributing to general grad student advoacy and community work.

**Personal**  
My hobbies before COVID-19 were rock climbine and snowshoeing. Unfortunately, neiter are really available in SoCal due to the pandemic and wildfire. 
My stay-at-home hobbies include cooking, body-weight training, and watching wholesome TV shows.
