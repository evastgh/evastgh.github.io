Stef’s Via Alpina Green experience

# Intro
Via Alpina Green is a through-hiking trail that traverses Switzerland. It is a part of the longer [Via Alpina Trail](http://www.via-alpina.org/en/) which traverses the Alps from Monaco to Slovenia. It is also labeled as the Swiss National Route 1. Hikers starts in Vaduz (Liechtenstein) and finishes in Montreux, crossing 14 mountain passes (saddle point of mountain ridges). The trail is divided into 20 sections with each section connecting one town to another. All these towns are accessible by public transit during the summer and have hotels and restaurants. Furthermore, hikers have the option to take funicular train / bus / cable car to skip through some parts of the hike, reducing the elevation gain / loss to accommodate one’s fitness level. I took these public transits at times to skip some steep parts / speed up the hike to make sure I finish in time / avoid getting rained on. This article is written with the intention to provide my own perspectives and to complement other existing online resources like the [official Via Alpina Green website by Swiss tourism bureau](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/summer-autumn/hiking/via-alpina/) or [Fabienne and Benoit](https://www.novo-monde.com/en/backpacking-switzerland/via-alpina-hike/).  

# Planning the trip
I used a large spreadsheet ([macOS Numbers](/files/ViaAlpinaGreen.numbers) and [.xlsx](/files/ViaAlpinaGreen.xlsx)) to plan my trip, filling it with hike info, lodging info, etc. I started planning and researching for the trip about half an year in advance, and I finished booking all my accommodations **two months in advance**. Most of the towns along Via Alpina are popular tourist desinations and have many hotels and frequent train / bus schedules, making the planning relatively easy. Urnerboden, Engstlenalp, Griesalp, L’Etivaz, and Rochers de Naye are the more remote towns and they require more planning effort (the bus / funicular train schedule is sparse and ends early in the evening, fewer hotels means earlier booking, etc.) 

### Time of the year
Via Alpina is a summer trail. Most online resources recommend hiking Via Alpina between mid-June to mid-September to avoid excessive snow in high altitude areas. I started on June 29 and finished on July 24 and only encountered small snow patches around Surenenpass and no where else. 

### My strategy: book lodgings for 2-3 nights each, and take public transit to travel from start / end points of the hike and my lodging
My favorite weather for hiking is partially cloudy partially sunny. Unlike some tough hikers, I don’t like hiking in heavy rain because wet shoes take ages to dry and the rain / clouds occludes the beautiful scenary. (I am even more rain-avoidant because my veteran hiking boots have holes in them.) The summer weather in Switzerland varies by the day, so I make my plan particularly flexible and choose my rest days based on the very accurate [MeteoSwiss](https://apps.apple.com/app/id589772015) weather forecast. I achieved it by staying for 2-3 days at each hotel / Airbnb, and use public transit to move between the start / end point of the hike and my lodging. If I had booked lodgings at each exact town along the route, I would have been restricted to hike each section following a schedule determined by my lodging location, without the ability to respond to weather forecast. Furthermore, I get to hike with lighter backpacks once in every couple days, because I can leave some weight (e.g. laundry and some food) at the lodging! Here is the list of cities / villages that I stayed at during my trip, most of which are within 1.5 hours by public transit from the area I was hiking during my stay. 
* Buchs (2 nights)
* Sargans (2 nights)
* Linthal (4 nights)
* Luzern (4 nights)
* Engstlenalp (1 night)
* Grindelwald (2 nights)
* Wengen (2 nights) 
* Griesalp (2 nights)
* Spiez (3 nights)
* Gstaad (2 nights)
* Chateau d’Oex (3 nights)
* Montreux (2 nights)
The cost of the lodgings ranges from USD 69 to USD 160 per night, but one can further reduce the cost by staying at shared rooms and dormitary style [youth hostels](https://www.youthhostel.ch/en/hostels/) (not an option for me due to health issues). In general, cheaper options (youth hostels and cheap hotels) in towns on the Via Alpina route get booked out a couple months in advance, but one can always pay more or book lodgings farther away from the trail. One advantage of staying at Airbnbs is the ease of doing laundry, as laundry service at hotels is not something I can / want to afford (often costs 5-10 franc per *piece of garment*, and takes more than 24h). Airbnbs are not really an option in the Grindelwald-Lauterbrunnen-Griesalp area, but I managed to find [a public laundry in Wengen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QqtAKrqsjQBAjgNT6?g_st=ic).  
I highly recommend using the extremely convenient and reliable [SBB Mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id294855237) to look up public transit schedules. I bought a [half-fare card for all Swiss public transport](https://www.swiss-pass.ch/swiss-half-fare-card/) upon arrival at Zürich airport for CHF 180, which was a good deal as I was taking lots of public transit during my trip. Note: I did encounter a mishap where SBB canceled the trains that I was planning to take. To SBB’s credit, they only canceled the trains from 21h-00h due to engineering work. I was saved by a friend who lives nearby and let me crash in short notice for a night. Thank you, Theo.

### Food and water
Restaurants in Switzerland are expensive. I buy food from grocery stores to keep my budget reasonable. Note that grocery stores (Migros, Coop, Aldi, etc) can close as early as 18h, especially in remote villages. Convenience stores (Migrolino, Coop Pronto, Avec, etc) near train stations are slightly more expensive and have less options but may have longer hours.  
There are many water fountains along hiking trails in Switzerland. On top of them, one can often easily find little creeks for filtering water. I found bring 2L of water sufficient to handle most of the hikes and I refill them whenever I'm near water source.  (Note: I did take public transport to skip some steep sections and cannot report conditions of those sections.)

### Navigation
I highly recommend [Switzerland Mobility app](https://apps.apple.com/app/id527194959) which is the official network for non-motorized traffic in Switzerland. Along the way you will also find clear signposts indicating the direction of “wanderweg” (walking trail) or “bergwanderweg / chemin de randonnée” (hiking trail), as well as white-red-white paint on rocks or trees or fences, or a yellow diamond-shaped marker.

### Backpack content
See [my Lighterpack list](https://lighterpack.com/r/90onsm) for the complete content of my backpack and the weight of each item. I intentionally chose to bring only 3 sets of clothing including the set I was wearing. I spent a lot of time doing laundry during this trip, but I got to pack light (28L backpack) so I could finish some long stretches as day-hikes with all my gears on my back. I bought the hiking poles after having my quadriceps destroyed by the 1450m (4756ft) elevation loss from Weisstannen - Elm, and wish that I had bought them at the beginning.  

# Things that I wish I had done differently
I really wish I had saved myself a couple more rest days near the beginning. I had to forfeit two segments due to illness and soreness during the first week. On the other hand, I was feeling really good and didn’t need to take some rest days that I had scheduled near the end of my trip. Another thing I wish I had done was to wash my backpack on my rest days when I had at least 24h to hang dry it. It was smelling really really foul at the end of the trip, from the insurmountable amount of sweat that it has soaked up.
